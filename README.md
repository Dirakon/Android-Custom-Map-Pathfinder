# Android-Custom-Map-Pathfinder
Just a little project that uses editable map from Google Sheets (map is easily editable in any moment) and finds the shortest path between two points. All is set up in Google Sheets: the layout, number of floors, objects etc.

Has fun version system that is controlled via the super google sheet. The idea behind this thing was for me to write this thing as backend and for my other team members to control the program via the sheet, but unfortunately after I finished my part I realised that I was the only one really intrested in the project, so only backend really exists. But that's really just how it is with my projects.
